description: >
 This shows basic use of object orientation in Ada, with an interface type
 being derived into a tagged type. In the initial version, the compiler rejects
 a derived type that fails to implement all abstract operations from its parent
 interface. In the compilable version, the safety of behavioral subtyping
 (weakening of preconditions and strengthening of postconditions) between the
 parent interface and the derived type cannot be proved. In the proved version,
 behavioral subtyping ensures that a dispatching call to the procedure with the
 contract satisfies the precondition of the call, whatever the dynamic type of
 the object.
