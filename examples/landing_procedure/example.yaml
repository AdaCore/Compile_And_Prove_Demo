description: >
 This shows basic use of object orientation in SPARK, with an interface type
 being derived into a tagged type. In the initial version, the safety of
 behavioral subtyping (weakening of preconditions and strengthening of
 postconditions) between the parent interface and the derived type cannot be
 proved. In the proved version, behavioral subtyping ensures that a
 dispatching call to the procedure satisfies the precondition of the call,
 whatever the dynamic type of the object.
