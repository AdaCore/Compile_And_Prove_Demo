name: Sensor Average
description: >
 This shows basic use of fixed-point types in SPARK (real types with a fixed
 precision contrary to floating-point types) and variables with memory-mapped
 addresses for sensors. In the initial version, the postcondition of a local
 function cannot be proved due to missing parentheses in an expression.
