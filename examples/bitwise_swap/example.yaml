name: Bitwise Swap
description: >
 This shows basic use of SPARK modular types (the unsigned of C/C++) with
 bitwise operators, and a contract relating input and output values of a
 procedure. In the initial version, the postcondition cannot be proved because
 a xor operation is missing. And yes, 3 xor equal a swap!
